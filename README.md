Thank you for using your time to play are game and giving us this oppertunity

The game sends the time that the runs took to a data base

we are using Unity cloud Diagnostics for crash reporting

For the Enemies we are usign astar path finding

the Sql data base saves the volume and graphics for the next time someone opens the game

All the art used in this game is made by our group

The game fetures a Persionalized map made with the unity tile map

All the sounds used in this game were made by our group

The game can have lasting appeal by trying to beat you previous scores

While many games of this genre use pixel art we decided to use our own art style

Our Characters that are in the game and going to be added were ideas that we had while writing charactes for D&D
